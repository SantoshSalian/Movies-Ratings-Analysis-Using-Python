# Movies-Ratings-Analysis-Using-Python

Analyzing the rating given by viewers of a movie helps many people decide whether or not to watch that movie. So for the Movie Rating Analysis task, you first need to have a dataset that contains data about the ratings given by each viewer. For this task, I have collected a dataset from Kaggle that contains two files: 
1. one file contains the data about the movie Id, title, genre of the movie, imdb ratings, budget, social media likes, etc .
2. other file contains the user id, movie id, ratings given by the user and the timestamp of the ratings.

You can download both these datasets from this repository.
